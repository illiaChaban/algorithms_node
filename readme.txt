anagram.js   ===> By replacing each of the letters in the word CARE 
with 1, 2, 9, and 6 respectively, we form a square number: 1296 = 362.
What is remarkable is that, by using the same digital substitutions,
the anagram, RACE, also forms a square number: 9216 = 962. We shall
call CARE (and RACE) a square anagram word pair and specify further
that leading zeroes are not permitted, neither may a different 
letter have the same digital value as another letter.

Using the attached words.txt file, a 16K text file containing 
nearly two-thousand common English words, find all the square 
anagram word pairs (a palindromic word is NOT considered to be 
an anagram of itself).

What is the largest square number formed by any member of such
 a pair?
NOTE: All anagrams formed must be contained in the given text file.

lattice.js  ===> Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, 
and only being able to move to the right and down, there are 
exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid? In an n x n grid?
